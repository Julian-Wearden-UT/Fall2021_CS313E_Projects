## Projects Overview

### Binary Trees
Helper methods for a binary search tree class.

### Circular Linked List
Josephus problem implementation using a custom circular linked list class.

### Expression Tree
Program to read an expression from a file, create an expression tree, and evaluate the expression. Program also finds prefix and postfix versions of the same expression.

### Graph Traversal
Depth first search and breadth first search of a graph of cities.

### Number Spiral
Creates an array of numbers that counts in the form of a spiral (1 at the center, 2 to the right, 3 below it, 4 to the left, and so on) for an arbitrary size.

### Real Estate Investment
A greedy algorithm that calculates the maximum profit a real estate investor can get from a given set of house listings.

### Simplified Cryptography
Encrypt and decrypt text by putting the text into an array and rotating the array 90 degrees.

### Solid Geometry
Classes for point, sphere, cube, and cylinder classes.

### Topological Sort
A code that generates a topological sort of given graph.

### Working Hard Problem
Runtime comparison of binary and linear search implementations to solve problem.
